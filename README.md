Hi, <br>
My name is Arshia Kohanteb and I am currently 15 (as of July 2019). I always wanted to make a website so thats exactly what I did. <br>
NameCheap offers students one free domain so I signed up and used my school email to rent [arshiakohanteb.me]#####(http://arshiakohanteb.me) <br>
Then I used [Github Pages](pages.github.com) to host the website. <br>
The rest is just learning how to use html and that is one long self tought journey. <br>
So Join me for the ride!
